Assignment03 Questions

1. How much time did you spend on this assignment?

A lot of hours. Not being able to make it to class hindered me on this assignment and it shows. There are a few things with the arrays I seemingly didn't pick up on.

2. What difficulties did you experience?

The arrays were tough and not having the proper knowledge of coding with them greatly affected me.

3. What were the results of running test cases?

For the most part, good. As I said though, there are a few bugs due to not knowing about some array coding.
